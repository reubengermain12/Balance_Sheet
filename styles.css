/*Before I get too far into my styling, I have made use of the sr-only class. I can use CSS to make elements with this class completely hidden from the visual page, but still be announced by screen readers.

The CSS I have written is a common set of properties used to ensure elements are completely hidden visually.

The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span element whose class includes sr-only.*/
span[class~="sr-only"] {
  border: 0;
}
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #0a0a23;
